<h1>Most Profitable CS2 Cases</h1>
<p>Profitability in CS2 case opening is relative — all cases have negative expected value on average. This page identifies which cases have the least negative EV, making them the relatively best options if you choose to open cases.</p>

<h2>Understanding Case Profitability</h2>
<p>A case is considered relatively profitable when its average return is closer to the opening cost. Cases with high-value coverts and desirable knife finishes tend to have better EV because the rare drops carry more value. However, since these rare drops occur at the same 0.64% (covert) and 0.26% (knife) rates across all cases, the day-to-day experience of opening any case is dominated by the same 80% Mil-Spec drops.</p>
